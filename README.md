I am a highly motivated and team-oriented Electrical and Electronics Engineer interested in applying my skills to the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. 
  
"NHL Predict Wins - Machine Learning"
  I create a project from scratch. I analyze NHL hockey team statistics from 2005-2022, clean the data, and build a regression model to predict the number of wins for each team in the 2021/2022 season. The results are excitingly accurate! I create 8 different regression models and analyze the prediction results using a visualization and Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error,	Median Squared Error,	Explain Variance Score, and	R2 Score.


"Pandas - Visualization"
 I expresses my familiarity with Core Data Science concepts. I clean, analyze, arrange, and merge two dataFrames culminating in a 3-D bar graph comparing the "Win/Loss ratio" to "Home Attendance" of Canadian NHL hockey teams.


"Machine Learning Familiarity"
  I apply classifier models to the breast_cancer data set through Sklearn and regression models to the diabetes data set through Sklearn. I compare a model to a Dummy Classifier proving the model is applied correctly and based on the relevant data. I show Cross Validation, Score, R_2 Score, Mean Squared Error, ROC, Recall, Scaled Vs. Non-Scaled (Normalization), Confusion Matrix. I apply hyperparameters and search for ideal values such as the regularization coefficient alpha/c.
  
  In the following sections I convey my understanding of Machine Learning Classifier models. I apply a KNN Classifier, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Kernalized Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted decision trees, and a Neural Network MLP classifier.
  
  In the following sections I analyze Machine Learning Regression Models. I apply KNN Regression, Polynomial Regression combined with Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. 
  
  Finally, I apply a simple K-Means cluster problem with a scatter plot.
